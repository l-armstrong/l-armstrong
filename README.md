I'm an Software Engineer with a strong interest in backend development, product development, user experience, and art. I love working on emulators, API design, programming at lower levels, and creating great user experience. 

Recectly I:
- Wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I worked on emulators, assemblers, and collabed on a bittorrent client. 
- Wrote Backend Software and Internal Tools for [Pixelberry Studios](https://www.pixelberrystudios.com/).
